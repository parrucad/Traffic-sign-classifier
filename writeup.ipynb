    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because light intensity information suffices for the image classification. This was also confirmed from the Yann Le Cunn's paper on traffic sign recognition. Then, I normalized so that the data so that it has mean zero and equal variance. For image data, I used the approximaiton: (pixel - 128)/ 128 due to its ease of implementation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other pre-processing steps that I used are: \n",
    "\n",
    "* random rotation where the rotation angle is uniformly distributed from -15 to +15 degrees.\n",
    "* random scaling with a scaling factor uniformly distributed between 0.9x and 1.1x\n",
    "* random translating with a random shift of up to +/- 2 lines or columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques help the classification algorithm to be more robust against effects of rotation, scaling and translation which often happen while the camera is mounted in a moving body (here is the car). It happens that images are captured from different angles due to ego path, they are shifted or depending on the distance to the car they are scaled.\n",
